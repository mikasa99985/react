It's my second project (PRESENT) . I shouldn't say mine. Because four of our members are working in it. but 80% is done by me and my friend.
run the folder in vscode .
open terminal window in vscode
type " install vite@latest "
then after it install " npm install "
run the code by command " npm run dev " .
It's an undergo project. Not done yet.
